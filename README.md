##Intro
**********************************

Basically, when fed a list of documents and the categories these files belong to, this program will use a
Naive-Bayes word frequency method to model the categories. This model can then be applied to identify documents of
unknown categories.

This is a simple package for document classification using a Naive-Bayes scheme (fairly well documented, so I won't
describe it here). The main package is fairly independent of I/O, but does require the training data, training labels, 
and test data to be formatted as described in the NaiveBayes documentation. 

##Usage
**********************************

An example script is provided in ExampleData.py, but the crux of this module are the following three lines:

    # create model
    nb = NaiveBayes.NaiveBayes()

    # train
    nb.fit(train_df, train_labels)

    # predict
    output = nb.predict(test_df)


##Thank you notes
**********************************

This base project was created as a project submission for the Summer 2014 section of MSAN 593, taught at the University
of San Francisco by Yannet Interian. I would like to thank her and the faculty for their support and guidance.

It has been updated as an assigment for the Module 2 2014 section of MSAN 621 Machine Learning, taught at the University
of San Francisco by Cynthia 'Cindi' Thompson. I would like to thank her and the faculty for their support and guidance.

As a side note, I've written all code in this package from scratch (excluding imports, obviously). As such, I am able
to make it available under the MIT License.# SpamFilters
